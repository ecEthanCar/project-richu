# Team Agreement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

Wondrous Raichu

## To what goals do we all commit?

-   Achieve a good score for the project

-   Learn and practice good data science skills

-   Have fun with data!

## Weekly meetings

Saturdays, 3 - 5 PM.

## Meeting "location"

Engineering Quad, wherever there is an empty classroom (e.g. Duffield, Upson, Olin, etc.). We can also try to meet it on Zoom if there are unforeseeable situations like illness/storm.

## Primary method of communication

iMessage and Slack.

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

If someone cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting, they should inform the group through the primary methods of communication listed above.

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

Everyone should have their portion of the lab completed before the lab section.

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

To the team member who fails to deliver what was promised, we will approach and ask why the individual was not able to deliver. We will try to resolve the issue first within the group. If the team member fails to demonstrate interest in sharing the responsibility of the project as a group, we will approach Professor Soltoff and the INFO 2950 staff for further advice.

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

Gimme Coffee, and Krispy Krunchy Chicken for celebration!

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
